# Map Side-by-side

Demo to show the map synthesis using cycle-GAN to convert open street map (OSM) images into historical map style. The historical map dataset used for training is downloaded from National Library of Scotland ([NLS](https://maps.nls.uk/)) website. 

This demo provides three radio buttons to toggle between three views. The first view compares the OSM map with the real historical map obtained from NLS website. The second view compares the input OSM map with the synthesized historical map, and the second view adds the text layer upon the synthesized historical map.
