# Synthetic Historical Map Generation Demo

This demo shows the map synthesis result with cycle-GAN to convert open street map (OSM) images into historical map style. The historical map training dataset for CycleGAN is obtained from the National Library of Scotland ([NLS](https://maps.nls.uk/)). 

This demo provides three radio buttons to toggle between the views. The first view compares the OSM map with the real historical map from the NLS website. The second view compares the input OSM map with the synthesized historical map, and the third view has the text layer overlayed upon the synthesized historical map.
